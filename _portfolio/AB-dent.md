short-description: Responsive app for a dentist office

---
B-dent application represents a modern dentist office on the Internet. Besides original visual identity, client required that application is ready for eventual second phase where online booking option could be presented to customers. This is the main reason why Angular-Rails combination is chosen for this project.  

The application is designed on the responsive design principles. Whole CSS code is written from scratch without help of external libraries. Power of Angular (special custom directives) is used to model or organize application in that way that it can be easily upgraded or changed depends on customer future requirements.
