Bloc Jams is main part of Bloc’s curriculum for teaching Front-end development. The application's main purpose is to allow users to search albums in their library and play music. This is “pure" front-end application and it looks cool.

The application is dynamic and consists of albums and songs with all necessary information, and song player with business logic made “from scratch” (for actual playing of songs, "Buzz" library has been used). Two versions of the application has been built. One is based purely on HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery, while for the other version power of Angular has been utilized. This was the good way to compare two applications built on different concepts.

While I was developing this application, I met with Angular for the first time. In the begging it was difficult to understand how Angular works, and why does something similar to "classic" MVC architecture exists in front-end development at all. Similarities with other concepts such as Rails development which can be full-stack, confused me even more. At the end when I figured it out, I fell in love with Angular. Although AJAX technology made web applications feel like desktop ones, Angular puts it on the new level.
