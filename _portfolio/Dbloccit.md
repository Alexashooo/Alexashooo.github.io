Bloccit is part of Bloc curriculum for Rails web development. It is similar to Reddit, where users can post, share, vote on and save links and comments.
The application has many elements of modern web development and it is made with production level of quality.

As a “teaching tool” this application is based on MVC architecture, but also includes important elements such as testing, user authorization and writing of API. All these concepts are discussed in depth and I learned a lot through their implementation.  Of course, to be able to use this techniques and technologies,
it was necessary to master HTML, CSS and Ruby, as well as Rails core architecture and principles, for instance "convention over configuration."
