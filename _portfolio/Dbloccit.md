Bloccit is an app which is part of Bloc curriculum for Rails web development. It is similar to Reddit, where users can post, share, vote on and save links and comments.
The app has many elements of modern web development and is also made with production level quality.

As a “teaching tool” this application is based on standard web development concepts such as MVC architecture, CRUD(or REST) operations, testing, users authorization and building of an API. All these concepts are discussed in depth and I learned a lot through their implementation.  Of course, to be able to use this technics and technologies,
it was necessary to master HTML, CSS and Ruby, as well as rails core architecture and principles such as "convention over configuration."
