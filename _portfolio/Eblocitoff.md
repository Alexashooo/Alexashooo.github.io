short-description: Blocitoff, awesome to-do app!

---
One of the most common little apps that almost every developers starts with is a to-do list. So, I am not the exception.

Requirements for the application are made by Bloc and it's purpose is to teach people main concepts in Rails, ruby and important techniques such as AJAX.
The application also using Devise gem for user authentication. To-do lists (or items) created by users are self-destructive if users does not check them after some time.

The application does not pretend to be anything else than just cool, simple to-do list, useful for improving development skills.
