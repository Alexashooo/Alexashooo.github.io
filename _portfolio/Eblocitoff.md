short-description: Blocitoff, awesome to-do app!

---
One of the most common applications that almost every developer starts with is a to-do list. So, I'm no exception.

Requirements for the application are made by Bloc and it's purpose is to teach people main concepts in Rails, Ruby and important techniques such as AJAX.
The application also using Devise gem for user authentication. To-do lists (or items) created by users are self-destructive if after some time.

The application does not pretend to be anything else than just cool, simple to-do list, useful for improving development skills.
