This application allows users to create public or private wikis depends on whether they have standard or premium account.

Wikis can be a good way to collaborate on projects that involves several people. The application allows users to have three different
rolls, admin, standard or premium. The premium user role is the most interesting because it requires subscription but users can create
private wikis and add or manage collaborators on a project or topic. For this purpose Stripe payment system has been implemented, which was very
interesting part of the project, at least for me as a developer. Blocipedia is Rails application.
