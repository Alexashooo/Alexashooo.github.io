This application allows users to create public or private wikis depends on whether they have standard or premium account.

Wikis can be a good way to collaborate on projects or any topic that involves several people. The application allows users to have three different
rolls, admin, standard or premium. The premium user role is the most interesting because it requires subscription which allows users not only to have
private wikis, but to add and manage collaborators on the project or topic. For this purpose, it is implemented Stripe payment system, which was at the same time
the most interesting part of the project for me as developer. The whole application is made in Rails.
