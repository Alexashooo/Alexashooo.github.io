title: How I decided to attend programming bootcamp
---

This could be explained in just one sentence: "I really wanted to become a developer!"

I am not following trends. I have not been in any kind of difficult situation that could influence me to make this decision. I am just impressed by different kind of "digital content" very often. I really like to code, and I did it many times before the bootcamp, but usually it was related to scripting and automation of some processes when I worked as transportation engineer/modeler.  So, I have never tried to develop whole application om my own before, and I have to say that feeling is awesome.

I took slow pace, I spent almost one and half year on the bootcamp (Bloc in my case), along side my regular 8-hour job. I used every minute of my free time for coding, reading and learning (and sometimes played some cool games, I am just a human). I was exploring  other stuff outside curriculum too, and I spent many hours by thinking what I really want to do while I was trying to exclude every "practical" thing that led me to make bad decisions in the past, which are related to my career.

Things in civil engineering industry are happening much slower, there is very little innovation and so many rules, and therefore there were too many repetitive tasks and boring projects which a I hated deeply. Development offers me freedom I always wanted. I really like to solve puzzles, I like to try something new, to invent something and to be challenged.

As a developer I would like to be in a position to work on a variety of applications I actually care for. Final product and it's usability, look an feel is very important to me. I would also like to try different technologies and approaches and to learn from the more experience colleagues. I think that I am gonna like dynamics and general mindset in IT industry. I have desire to start my own projects too (which I already did) and to experiment and make something which is not influenced by anything else but my imagination.
