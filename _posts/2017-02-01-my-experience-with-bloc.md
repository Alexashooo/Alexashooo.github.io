title: My experience with Bloc and challenges I faced on my journey to become developer
---

In general, I think that idea of establishing programming bootcamps is good, and in the next few paragraphs I will try to explain why this kind of education suited me well and what is the most important thing that I learned on the Bloc.   

I choose Bloc because I got impression from reviews and comments I read online that it is a serious “school” and that their curriculum is good, according to more experienced developers. Equally important to me was that everything happens on-line, I could keep my job and work on a new skills.

I believe that nobody can make you a good programmer/developer if you don't put enough effort in that (to have a talent helps too), but I do believe that right people can show you the way. Today we have available everything about modern technologies online, for free,  but as beginner you have to learn so much at a time that is very easy to get lost and be frustrated. In my case, It helped to have some kind of structure (or "learning framework", not just curriculum) to follow, and I think that saved me a lot of time.

To work as professional developer is a demanding job (as I've been told :-)) and it happens very often that you need to cope with technologies and problems  you don't have much experience with. On the Bloc (I assume that this is similar to other bootcamps), they put you straight "in to the fire" from the beginning and you are introduced to several technologies and concepts at the same time. Technologies that Bloc teaching their students are carefully chosen and they reflects demand on the market, while they are suitable for teaching web development concept as a whole.
But I was not alone there, I had my mentors (in Bloc’s case), students and other people that helped me with organizational and technical stuff.

To be a student on the bootcamp, as I mentioned above, is quite demanding because you have to grasp so many things to be productive at all. Good curriculum and skillful mentors are beautiful things but still it is important to connect all the dots in your head. It takes time and lot of practice. I practiced a lot beside the things required in the curriculum. For me personally, as I always did some programming in a different languages (but not applications development), writing algorithms and learning new programming languages was not that hard.  But to learn new architectures and different frameworks and understand deeply why are they made in a such way they are, can be hard for beginners.

I think that it is obsolete to talk just about technologies I learned. Everything changes very fast and after all, I believe,  you end up with understanding of core technologies and concepts, and knowledge how to learn new things faster. For me personally the largest obstacle was fear and how to overcome it. Bloc's stuff, while they are writing the curriculum, had to address difficult things that beginners will face on their journey and explain them in a concise and easy-to-understand way. And I think that they are succeeded.

Reading official documentation is extremely important, but sometimes you simply don't have a time. Documentation on Bloc, from pedagogical aspect, is well written and mentors that you choose following the same principles. They are flexible and has different approach to every student. I am aware that there is no two identical persons with identical programming/technical and interpersonal skills, but I had good connection with my mentors. At the end, if you do not like them, Bloc allows you to change them.

Once I felt that I am capable to start to make applications on my own, it felt wonderful. All my worries about my skills and capabilities and future job search was gone. I choose one final project which connects all technologies I learned in back-end part of the curriculum with front-end, in this case Rails and Angular as frameworks, and JS, HTML, CSS and jQuery. The application is non-trivial and you can read about it in my portfolio.
